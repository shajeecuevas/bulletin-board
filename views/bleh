I am a autodidect, which means I learn well on my own.
I'm also a very inquisitive person. I always want to know the "why" of things. 
I enjoy listening to people's stories because there's always something to learn.

I would like to help people and be the person that I wish I had when I was young. 

I create applications and web pages. This helps myself and 
other people have a concise blueprint of what he/she/I wants to accomplish. I do 
it because it's fun and the challenge keeps me busy.

Hi my name is Shajee Cuevas! I'm a junior developer with an interest in front end
development and a goal to transition to a full stack developer. I'm goal-oriented and
good on my toes. With my analytical I am a great addition to any team.
